## **Decision Process Guidelines**

### **Before Each Phase**

1. **Review dependencies**: Ensure all prerequisite decisions are complete
2. **Gather context**: Analyze current usage patterns and requirements
3. **Schedule decision sessions**: Architecture review meetings
4. **Document decisions**: Update relevant specification files
5. **Validate decisions**: Prototype critical patterns if uncertain

### **Decision Session Format**

1. **Context review** (10 min): What needs to be decided and why
2. **Options analysis** (20 min): Pros/cons of each approach
3. **Discussion** (20 min): Team input and clarification
4. **Decision** (5 min): Choose option and document rationale
5. **Implementation planning** (5 min): Next steps and validation

### **Decision Documentation**

Each decision should be documented with:

- **Context**: Why this decision is needed
- **Options considered**: All viable approaches
- **Decision made**: Chosen option with rationale
- **Impact**: Expected consequences and implementation notes
- **Validation**: How to verify the decision was correct

---

**Remember**: These decisions shape how thousands of developers will use Kairo V2. Take time to get them right, but don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Decisions can be refined based on real usage feedback.
