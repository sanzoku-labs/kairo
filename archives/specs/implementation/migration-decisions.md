2. Should V2 provide V1 compatibility? (affects architecture)

### **Before Phase 6 (Migration)**
1. How much should be invested in migration tooling?
2. How should breaking changes be communicated?
3. How should migrations be validated?
4. Should migrations be incremental or all-at-once?
5. How should migration success be measured?

## **Next Steps After Migration Decisions**

1. **Update implementation timeline** based on chosen migration strategy
2. **Plan V1 maintenance resources** according to support timeline
3. **Design V2 architecture** with compatibility layer requirements
4. **Scope migration tooling development** based on investment level
5. **Create migration communication plan** based on chosen strategy
