# Archived Concepts

This folder contains ideas and specifications that were considered but not implemented in the current roadmap.

## Why These Are Archived

### Migration Tools (archived 2025-01-17)

**Reason**: While technically feasible and potentially valuable, migration tools would break Kairo's core philosophy of framework agnosticism. Creating adapters for specific frameworks (Express, Fastify, Next.js) would tie Kairo to particular ecosystems and contradict its design principle of being a pure, unopinionated platform.

**Status**: Preserved for potential future consideration if strategic direction changes.

**Location**: `./migration/`

### Simple Mode (archived 2025-01-17)

**Reason**: Simple Mode would add unnecessary complexity to Kairo by creating two APIs developers need to learn. After analysis, the real problem is not that Kairo's API is complex, but that it needs better curation, progressive learning paths, and improved discoverability. Adding another abstraction layer contradicts Kairo's principle of clarity and explicitness.

**Status**: Archived in favor of API curation and learning experience improvements.
