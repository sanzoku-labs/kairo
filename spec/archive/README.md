# Archived Concepts

This folder contains ideas and specifications that were considered but not implemented in the current roadmap.

## Why These Are Archived

### Migration Tools (archived 2025-01-17)

**Reason**: While technically feasible and potentially valuable, migration tools would break Kairo's core philosophy of framework agnosticism. Creating adapters for specific frameworks (Express, Fastify, Next.js) would tie Kairo to particular ecosystems and contradict its design principle of being a pure, unopinionated platform.

**Status**: Preserved for potential future consideration if strategic direction changes.

**Location**: `./migration/`
