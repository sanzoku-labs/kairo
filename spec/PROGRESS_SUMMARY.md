- FP parameter processing using `isNil`, `isEmpty` for validation
- Strategic `tap` usage for non-intrusive development logging
- Pipeline configuration enhanced with `maybe` patterns
- URL interpolation improved with FP validation
- **Test Results:** 44/44 tests passing

#### ⚙️ PROCESS Pillar - `src/core/pipeline.ts` ✅
**Enhancements Applied:**
- Enhanced step composition with improved `pipe` usage
- Strategic `tap` usage for pipeline lifecycle events
- Conditional logic for cache configuration and parallel execution
- Performance monitoring integrated with FP patterns
- Trace enhancement with FP data transformation
- **Test Results:** 29/29 tests passing

#### 🗃️ DATA Pillar - `src/core/repository.ts` ✅
**Enhancements Applied:**
- Enhanced validation with `isNil`, `isEmpty` for input validation
- Conditional logic using `cond` for timestamp handling
- Strategic `tap` usage for repository operations
- Maybe patterns for enhanced hook handling
- Improved error context and reporting
- **Test Results:** 24/24 tests passing
