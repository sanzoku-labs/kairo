### 🏗️ Day 5: Implementation & Organization
**✅ COMPLETED**: Reorganized API exports with tier-based options

1. **Reorganized src/index.ts**
   - **Tier 1 First**: Essential foundation clearly marked and grouped
   - **Tier 2 Second**: Production additions with clear rationale
   - **Tier 3 Guidance**: Extension import patterns and learning tracks
   - **Enhanced JSDoc**: Function counts, learning goals, usage guidance

2. **Tier-Based Export Files**
   - `src/beginner.ts` (5 functions): Gentle introduction for new users
   - `src/essential.ts` (8 functions): Minimal viable API for real apps
   - `src/tier1.ts` (15 functions): Complete foundation patterns
   - `src/tier2.ts` (40 functions): Production-ready with all enhancements
   - `src/TIERS_README.md`: Complete usage guide and migration strategy

3. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Clear JSDoc annotations with learning guidance
   - Function counts and tier rationale  
   - Import examples and bundle size estimates
   - Migration strategies for existing teams
