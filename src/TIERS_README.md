## Learning Path Recommendations

### 1. Beginner ‚Üí Essential (Week 1-2)
```typescript
// Week 1: Start with basics
import { Result, schema, pipeline } from 'kairo/beginner'

// Week 2: Add core capabilities  
import { Result, schema, pipeline, resource, repository } from 'kairo/essential'
```

### 2. Essential ‚Üí Tier 1 (Week 3-5)
```typescript
// Week 3-4: Add business logic
import { rule, rules, hasMany, hasOne } from 'kairo/tier1'

// Week 5: Master complete foundation
import * from 'kairo/tier1'
```

### 3. Tier 1 ‚Üí Tier 2 (Week 6-10)  
```typescript
// Week 6-7: Add production resilience
import { retry, timeout, tracing } from 'kairo/tier2'

// Week 8-10: Master production patterns
import * from 'kairo/tier2'
```

### 4. Tier 2 ‚Üí Extensions (Week 11+)
```typescript
// Choose specialization tracks
import { eventBus, saga } from 'kairo/extensions/events'
import { CacheManager } from 'kairo/extensions/caching'
import { transactionManager } from 'kairo/extensions/transactions'
```

## Bundle Size Impact

| Import | Functions | Estimated Size* | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| `kairo/beginner` | 5 | ~15KB | Learning |
| `kairo/essential` | 8 | ~25KB | Minimal apps |
| `kairo/tier1` | 15 | ~35KB | Complete foundation |
| `kairo/tier2` | 40 | ~50KB | Production apps |
| `kairo` | 40+ | ~55KB | Full convenience |

*Minified + gzipped estimates. Actual size depends on usage.

## Migration Guide

### From Full Import to Tiered
```typescript
// Before: Import everything
import { Result, schema, pipeline, /* many more */ } from 'kairo'

// After: Import only what you need
import { Result, schema, pipeline } from 'kairo/tier1'
```

### Adding Functions as Needed
```typescript
// Start small
import { Result, schema } from 'kairo/beginner'

// Add capabilities progressively
import { Result, schema, resource } from 'kairo/essential'
import { Result, schema, resource, rule } from 'kairo/tier1'
```

### Team Migration Strategy
1. **Week 1**: Everyone starts with `kairo/beginner`
2. **Week 2-3**: Move to `kairo/tier1` as foundation solidifies
3. **Week 4-6**: Adopt `kairo/tier2` for production features
4. **Week 7+**: Selective extension adoption based on needs

This tiered approach ensures teams can adopt Kairo at their own pace while maintaining access to the full power of the framework when needed.
