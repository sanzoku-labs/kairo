# Learning Paths

**Structured progression from beginner to expert with clear milestones and checkpoints.**

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

Kairo uses a **tiered learning approach** that builds systematically:

1. **Foundation (5 functions)** → Build confidence with core patterns
2. **Essential (8 functions)** → Create real applications  
3. **Tier 1 (15 functions)** → Production-ready development
4. **Tier 2 (40 functions)** → Professional-grade applications
5. **Tier 3 (285+ functions)** → Advanced specialization

Each tier introduces **incrementally more complexity** while building on previous knowledge.
