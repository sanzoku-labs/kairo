### Prerequisites Check
Before advancing to Application tier, you must demonstrate:

#### Core Knowledge ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Result Pattern Mastery**: Can explain when/why to use Result vs exceptions
- [ ] **Schema Understanding**: Can create complex schemas with validation
- [ ] **Pipeline Composition**: Can build multi-step data processing workflows
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Can use `match` to handle all success/failure cases
- [ ] **Functional Thinking**: Understands immutability and pure functions

#### Practical Skills ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Built Complete App**: Created working application using all 5 foundation functions
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Implemented form/API validation with clear error messages
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Handled and displayed validation errors gracefully
- [ ] **Code Organization**: Functions are pure, reusable, and well-named
- [ ] **Testing Mindset**: Can verify each step of pipeline works correctly

#### Assessment Challenge üß™
**Build a Contact Management System** that:
1. Validates contact data (name, email, phone, address)
2. Transforms data (normalize email, format phone, create display name)
3. Handles validation errors with user-friendly messages
4. Processes multiple contacts and reports success/failure rates

```typescript
// Must use only Foundation functions
import { Result, schema, pipeline, map, match } from 'kairo/beginner'

// Your implementation here...
const contactProcessor = pipeline('contact-processor')
  .input(ContactSchema)
  .map(/* your transformations */)

// Must handle batch processing
const processBatch = async (contacts: any[]) => {
  // Your batch processing logic
}
```

- [ ] All contacts with valid data are processed correctly
- [ ] Invalid contacts are rejected with specific error messages
- [ ] Batch processing reports accurate success/failure statistics
- [ ] Code is readable and follows functional programming principles
- [ ] No exceptions are thrown - all errors handled via Result pattern

3. Implements business rules (inventory checks, price validation, user permissions)
4. Handles failures gracefully (API timeouts, validation errors, insufficient stock)
5. Optimizes performance with caching

```typescript
// Must use Tier 1 functions
import { 
  Result, schema, pipeline, resource, repository,
  hasMany, belongsTo, rule, rules, cache
} from 'kairo/tier1'

// Your implementation must include:
// - Order validation pipeline with business rules
// - Product inventory management with relationships
// - Payment processing with external API integration
